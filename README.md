Engineered a full-stack password management system using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, and MongoDB for secure, persistent storage of user credentials.

Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints in Express.js with asynchronous CRUD operations, and validated API responses using Postman.

Leveraged MongoDB as a NoSQL backend to persist sensitive data with schema modeling via Mongoose, ensuring scalability and efficient data querying.

Utilized React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management, implemented input validation, conditional rendering (e.g., show/hide passwords), and responsive UI components with Tailwind CSS.
